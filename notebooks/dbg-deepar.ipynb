    "\n",
    "As we observed during data analysis phase that there are certain stocks that are clustered relatively more, based on their past price trends. Naturally, using these similarly moving stock would increase overall model performance, in absence of any other available external time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, like before, use the stocks of companies in automobile industry, and tjhe closing price of these series as the time series' of choice, for the model to build upon. THe difference here however is that, we do not have to specify which is the main series, and which ones are exogenous. DeepAR algorithm works to build a model that accounts for trends in all provided time series, and can generate forecast on any of those. This saves you the hassle of building different models for different time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we used covariate time series in our custom RNN example, we can use such series on DeepAR, by using the Dynamic Features. The data formatting function works to take all covariate columns, and format those as dynamic features for each time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in effect, following the configuration below, you end up having 6 time series' - the closing prices of the 6 stocks, each with 3 dynamic feature series' - opening price, and minimum and maximum prices."

    "1. We made improvements from our custom RNN code, by using stocks identified to belong to a cluster - `BMW`, `Chrysler`, `Volkswagon`, `Contiental` and `Porsche`, together as time series' in DeepAR model. Having a ARIMAx model trained across the cross sections of these individiual series' helped us improve upon the prediction, and allowe dus to generate forecast for any stocks within the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We used closing price as target series to predict, and to demonstrate the dynamic feature, used opening, minimum and maximum price as covariates. However this is not possible in reality. The values of series' used as dynamic features need to be know across the forecast horizon. Therfore the accuracy that we experience above is somewhat artificial, in that we are forecasting closing prices, knowing the opening, minimum and maximum prices, which is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use dynamic features, in reality, you need to find data sources that can be known before, These could be:\n",
    "    - Companies' forward looking sales/revenue targets\n",
    "    - Analysts guidances on stock prices\n",
    "    - Economic forecasts from other sources\n",
    "    - Price trends of future options, base don the underlying stock\n",
